<p>The process of assisting students in finding suitable job opportunities and internships that align with their academic qualifications, skills, and career goals. It is a crucial aspect of any educational institution's responsibility towards its students' future. Student placement programs are designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry by facilitating interactions with potential employers. These programs typically include activities such as career counseling, resume building, interview preparation, and arranging on-campus recruitment drives. The ultimate goal of student placement is to provide students with valuable work experience and help them kick-start their professional careers. It also benefits employers by giving them access to a pool of talented and well-prepared candidates. Successful student placements not only contribute to the students' individual growth but also enhance the reputation of the educational institution in producing industry-ready graduates.
